    <br>
    <h2>Q: How do I vote?</h2>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Q: Can I create my own username and password?</h2>
    <h5>A: No. The Nomelec committee will create and assign a unique username and password for each voter to prevent others from creating an unauthorized account for self or others thus preventing "flying votes".</h5>

    <h2>Q: How do I know if my ballot was sent or counted?</h2>
    <h5>A: You will receive an automatic confirmation message that says "This form has been successfully submitted" immediately after you click submit.

    <h2>Q: How do I know if my vote was counted? </h2>
